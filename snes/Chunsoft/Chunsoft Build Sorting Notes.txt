Total number of known unique builds: 5

NOTE: The comparison methodology used to confirm a unique build was opcode-based rather than memory location-based. In addition, Fushigi no Dungeon 2 - Fuurai no Shiren stores its music on the SNES side and translates them to commands for the SPC700 to execute. Its relationship to the other four games has not yet been examined yet music format-wise.
