Total number of known unique builds: Unknown
An opcode-based comparison methodology would be required due to game-specific sound data being stored beforehand. In addition, the vast majority of the builds start at $0200, which is overwritten relatively early on. The maximum possible count is currently 35 going by the number of builds that I have not matched to anything else in terms of opcode comparisons.

(NOTE: Except for Pop 'n Twinbee, which starts at $0BE5, all of these would normally start at $0200. However, they get overwritten AND there is game-specific sound data beyond this point resulting in massive differences prior to the code, where the code may or may not be subject to additional differences)
